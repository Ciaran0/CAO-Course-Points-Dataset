The Mid point is the points score of the applicant in the middle of a list of offerees placed in points score order. Applicants who are offered places might not necessarily accept a place. In most cases, the points scores shown here are based on performance in the Leaving Certificate. Applicants offered on mature grounds are not accounted for in this chart, with the exception of applicants for Mature Code nursing courses.

The midpoint and final point values can be annotated with additional information.
